    "review_text": "I absolutely LOVED my Echo. I purchased it from a large, reputable electronics retailer in April 2016. Unfortunately, it quit working a month past the warranty. The Echo stopped responding one day (no lights, sounds or any kind of response). I worked through all of the recommended steps from unplugging the Echo, unplugging my router and modem and restarting everything to performing a factory reset and trying a new power adaptor. Nothing worked. I contacted Amazon about this. Amazon confirmed that my Echo no longer worked and I was offered a 15 percent discount on the purchase of a new Echo. After spending close to $200 on a product that lasted 13 months, this offer fell flat with me. I chose to write this review to warn others that the issue with my Echo (dying after a year) is a common issue. This is a great product, but the quality isn't there. If you purchase it, be sure to get the extra warranty coverage and factor that into the total cost of the purchase. Amazon needs to do a much better job of taking care of its loyal customers. This was a huge disappointment and definitely makes me think twice about ordering a larger ticket item from Amazon.",

    "review_text": "I absolutely LOVED my Echo. I purchased it from a large, reputable electronics retailer in April 2016. Unfortunately, it quit working a month past the warranty. The Echo stopped responding one day (no lights, sounds or any kind of response). I worked through all of the recommended steps from unplugging the Echo, unplugging my router and modem and restarting everything to performing a factory reset and trying a new power adaptor. Nothing worked. I contacted Amazon about this. Amazon confirmed that my Echo no longer worked and I was offered a 15 percent discount on the purchase of a new Echo. After spending close to $200 on a product that lasted 13 months, this offer fell flat with me. I chose to write this review to warn others that the issue with my Echo (dying after a year) is a common issue. This is a great product, but the quality isn't there. If you purchase it, be sure to get the extra warranty coverage and factor that into the total cost of the purchase. Amazon needs to do a much better job of taking care of its loyal customers. This was a huge disappointment and definitely makes me think twice about ordering a larger ticket item from Amazon.",

For 179$ and from a maker such as Amazon you would expect that their items would last longer then a year! I am so disappointed. I can not see investing in another one for a year. I have 2 other dots and a google home and 2 google minis.  I loved the echo the best, it has the best sound over any of them.

After about an hour of phone time Amazon finally agreed that the Echo was non-operational and provided the means to return it.  The original Echo had taken 10 days to arrive and the replacement took an additional 5 days, as it was to be a gift, the lengthy delay was quite inconvenient. When the replacement did come, it appeared to be new and unused and worked instantly right out of the box.  Bottom line, I felt a bit jerked around by the shoddy packaging, malfunction and long delay from purchase to usefulness but the fact the I got a new unit the performs flawlessly for the cost of a refurb solved the wounds a bit.",

It plays songs whose artists begin with a number, the letter A, or the letter Z, or Recently uploaded songs, and that's it!!!!!!  It will play the same songs over and over again when I ask Alexa to shuffle songs (I have several thousand songs loaded to my Amazon account).  I've called Amazon several times and they say they are working on it (BTW Amazon customer service center is located in Costa Rica and the operators are very difficult to understand). This has been going on for about a year now and they have not fixed this terribly annoying problem.  I have seen other discussions in the Kindle forum about this, so I know there are lots of others experiencing the same problem.  Can anyone out there help?",

I put my trust in Amazon to buy the refurbished device , But after hooking it up it would not stay connected to the Internet. Regardless of where I moved it in the house, or exchange this location with other working devices, it would not stay connected to the Internet. I initiated a replacement request well before the expiration date.  The Amazon technician put me through the hoops of unplugging it, resetting it to factory settings, rebooting it multiple times, having me connect to a different Wi-Fi, (I even ordered a new Wi-Fi service with 10 times the band  with and download speed.) Which cost me an extra $50 a month! After multiple attempts at everything they suggested I told the representative I just wanted it replaced.  She had me give her all the information from my Internet provider about their radio signal their security system even the hardware and software versions of the companies router. Unfortunately last week I had a heart attack and had to be in the  hospital for three days. They tried to contact me while I was in the hospital once again to fiddle with this adjustments in settings of which there really are none and I told them I couldn't speak because I was in the hospital. This morning they contacted me again after being released and having reached my  Frustration of jumping through hoops and doing the same things for the fourth and fifth time I just said to them I'm tired of dealing with this either send me a replacement or I'll just throw this one in the garbage. And their response was we can't send you a replacement, because now it's outside the 30 day window!",

    "review_text": "I have the Amazon Echo and two Echo Dots.  I also have a Google Home Mini.  To be honest, I think I'm going to sell all my Amazon Echo devices and just switch wholesale to Google Home.  I have a smart house (Nest Thermostat, Nest Cameras, assorted smart switches and smart light bulbs, etc.)  To be honest, both Amazon Echo and Google Home controls them just fine.  In fact, I actually like how Google Home operates.  For example, I can name one light the \"Bedroom Light\" and another the \"Bedroom Desk Light\".  With just one command, \"Hey Google, turn on the bedroom lights\", I can turn on both.  Or I can turn them on individually by giving the exact name.  When I give this command to Alexa, it will ask me which device, saying that I have more than one device named this.  Also, Google Home has routines so I can turn off all my lights, set an alarm, and play some sleep sounds for going to sleep among other things.  Also, Amazon Echo does not work with Google Music (I kind of expected this) or Amazon's own bought music (you have to subscribe to Amazon Music).  But Google Music is so much better with the free option, giving you 50,000 songs to upload.  Amazon keeps scaling back their free services, namely the Amazon Music uploading and Amazon Cloud Drive (used to be unlimited storage and then scaled WAY back), so generally Amazon is getting worse.",

    "review_text": "Item worked ok out of the box, but soon started to experience intermittent connection issues.  Every other wi-fi enabled device in my home had no issues, so it was not the network.  At first, a reset would remedy the issue.  Eventually, after a couple months, it would not connect to wi-fi at all, despite the app telling me it was connected.  Tried numerous troubleshooting methods, reinstalled app, setting up as if it were new, factory reset, etc.  Still just an orange ring and no activity.  So, put in for a refund/replacement and first e-mail gives me troubleshooting tips (that have all been previously attempted with no luck).  Second request for a replacement or refund gets me an e-mail that I have to call on the phone.  Unfortunately, working very long and odd hours I put the call in from work.  Despite telling the operator that I have tried every single thing that he suggests to me, he refuses to offer me a replacement or refund unless I am physically with the device and trying AGAIN the exact things I have tried before multiple times, but with him on the line.  I am tech savvy and not an idiot.  But Amazon seems to want to treat me like one if it gets them out of providing service.  I am a long time customer and have placed about 70 orders in the last 6 months as well as being a Prime subscriber.  But if this is how Amazon treats their loyal consumers, I think I will have to take my business elsewhere.  At this point, I may just throw the Echo against the nearest wall and wait for Google's device to arrive.  And really, even when the Echo worked, it really didn't offer much other than the weather and sports scores.  The light switch control can be done with a Wemo app without even needing it.  Sorely disappointed in this poorly constructed gimmick.  Even more disappointed that Amazon seems to want to spend more effort jerking me around than actually resolve my issue with their defective product.",

After it sitting on a shelf for over a year. It mysteriously lost all function. No lights, no sound, acted as though it was not receiving power. I tried multiple adapters and the \"reset\" button, followed the troubleshooting procedure and to no avail. Then I called Amazon's support team to what I would expect to be a straightforward replacement situation where the device had a fault and had failed. 2 hours and 7 people later all they could offer was a slight discount on purchasing a new echo...I'm not impressed. I have always utilized Amazon and their devices. I was a devout and loyal customer, after this experience I am surely shaken. I would not recommend this product to anyone who feels they should get more than 1 year usage out of it, as should it fail. You will be out the money and if you want a discount on your failed device a few hours of your time and quite a few redundant conversations with incompetent support staff. Amazon, my far you have fallen in my eyes. Buy a different device from another brand such as the google home, way lower price and you get the same type of support...I paid more, because I expected more from Amazon. Lesson Learned.",

This device was a little buggy, so we put it in a room we don't typically use. About six months ago we moved it to our kitchen. Unfortunately, every few days it needs to be reset, which severely limits its functionality.  We are looking for a new voice assistant now and are reluctant to try an Echo again because we are past the customer support window. It is clearly a defective device and it is unfortunate that there's no longer support for it.",

The Echo wouldn't set up, the app kept going back to the connection screen.  After far too much time exploring answers on Google I got it connected before opening the app.  So the Echo responded to Alexa and worked as expected, but the iOS app on my iPhone and iPad keeps going back to the \"Begin Setup\" screens and loops through that over and over.  I finally called Amazon and was told that their Alexa app doesn't work with the new version of iOS released a week and half ago.  I tried to go to alexa.amazon.com on both Safari and Chrome and get the same screen as the app.",

This happened on our prior unit, and I presumed it had somehow become damaged.  So I bought this refurbished unit (because no new ones were available), and it does the same thing.  I have determined that it is most definitely not an issue of our wifi signal dropping, as it is a hearty and consistent signal on every other device we use.  I think it has something to do with an Echo update, as this refurbished unit worked just fine until Amazon on it's own updated it (which the Echo announced).  Very frustrating and waste of money.",

Today is Oct 1, 2017 and no reply from Amazon. I called them back, someone from India answered and he didn't even know what an Echo Dot was, I thanked him and hung up. I called again and someone who fortunately knew what an Echo Dot was, but he couldn't find anything that would prove my problem, I waited many minutes and finally transferred me to a supervisor, again I had to explain my problem, and, finally after talking to few more people and with a tracking # they finally realized what the problem was. After about 2 hours, they said that I would receive new Echo Dot, by this time my patience was gone, and I told them that since I was inconvenienced for several months they should make me happy and send me the new Echo +. They said that that couldn't be done. I said fine, but I was very unhappy. They called me back requesting me to edit my credit card, and still don't understand why I was on the line for another 30 minutes since the credit card was the same.",

I feel duped.  Reading other reviews it appears that this is not an uncommon issue, where the Echo stopped producing audio yet seems to be otherwise responsive (lighting up when you call \"alexa\", etc).  Of course this had to be what caused it to be refurbished in the first place. If you unplug it and replug it in, it works for a while, then hours later stops working. The worst part is I bought this for employees at my office and now 17 people thing its garbage.",

    "review_text": "First, let me say that the device works well, unless you are trying to use it with Sirius XM. Unfortunately for me, I bought in to the Echo technology specifically because it was advertised as working with Sirius XM. It works flawlessly with Amazon Music. But I pay a premium for Sirius XM; I like the programming, and want to use that programming with Echo. Sirius XM on Echo devices (I bought three) is a huge disappointment. If you want to use this with Sirius XM, you had best get used to hearing Alexa say, \"Sorry, I am having trouble playing the music.\" If you report this to Amazon customer service, they will reply telling you to 1- delink your Sirius XM account, 2- uninstall the Alexa app from your phone, 3- unplug your Echo devices, 4- plug your Echo devices back in, 5- re-install the Alexa app, and 6- re-link your Sirius XM account. Yes folks, this is what they tell you EVERY TIME. Believe me when I tell you... it doesn't help. Based on my experience with this device and other music services, I can say with a high degree of certainty that it is primarily a Sirius XM problem, not an Amazon problem. But for me, the only reason I bought Echo devices was for Sirius XM. I remember when the Android app was new to Sirius XM. It took Sirius XM YEARS (no exaggeration) to get their Android app working reliably. Today it's a great app, but it was a very rocky road getting to this point. It looks like Sirius XM is going down the same road with Echo. I really don't know that I want to hang out for years until they get it right. But I'm stuck with three Echo devices; an Echo (first generation), a Dot, and a Tap. Same Sirius XM problems on all three. We'll see if it get better as time goes on. But I don't expect it to be any time soon.",

Other times I use the echo it works but usually it just turns off.  I've always been happy with amazon products but my experience with the echo hasn't been good.",

It is constantly losing wifi and reconnecting to it is a total pain in the ass because you have to press a button to enter set up mode, change the network on a device to connect to the Echo, then connect to the network.  I've had to do this three times in the past 5 days.  Annoying doesn't even begin to describe it.  Was only keeping it around because of its speakers, but  I would be better off with a $20 bluetooth speaker that isn't going to keep track of what I'm up to or record my conversations.",

    "review_text": "I got the Echo for Christmas, and had to return it.  Initial set-up was bumpy with a snag during the connection to wi-fi, but I got past that.  The Echo worked well for about 1 day.  The next day, it was non-responsive.  According to the Alexa app, it was off-line for some reason.  So, I followed Amazon online technical instructions to trouble-shoot, which ran the gamut from powering off Echo, resetting Echo, to resetting my home wi-fi.  I Googled this error and found that it was apparently quite common.  What a shame that a device that's supposed to be smart and make our lives better and easier should be this complicated to set up and stay functional!  Amazon should take a hard and critical look at this product and consider withholding sales of this product until the technology is perfected and the kinks are ironed on. Connecting to wi-fi should be a very simple and basic things.  All my other \"un-smart\" devices had no problems getting connected and staying connected.  I'm extremely disappointed.  After wasting a few hours on this, I decided that this wasn't worth it and returned the product.  One more thing to consider is that I make a living with business-intelligence software development and I'm generally very tech savvy.  If a software engineer can't make this device work, what chances have the non-technical masses?  Again, deep disappointment with a product that has great potential but was poorly engineered and tested.",

And it gets annoying - we have to keep telling it to turn off the bluetooth (which the Echo enables) of the TV since it degrades the sound.  And, next to the TV, it sporadically starts a conversation - some combination of words must have activated it.  And it's lunacy to have both the Tap and Echo react to the word \"Alexa\" - honestly, what were they thinking to enable both to start chatting at their own tempo and with different types of music on their own, just by using that name?

Customer serviced called right back many many times each time saying it was something wrong with the wifi at home or the operator. When I suggested exchanging the unit the idea was dismissed. \"The team is still working on your issue\" Then \"the team\" suggests exchanging unit but I have to call. So I call. Now I need all the private info about the giver of the gift- which wouldn't be such an issue except my brother is deployed across the world and 5 time zones. Would not recommend this product nor the customer service. That being said, those I spoke to were always kind, polite, and easy to understand. That is certainly appreciated.

    "review_text": "So today is my birthday. My husband bought me the echo as a gift. We live in the Caribbean. I have been a Prime member for years now, paying $100.00 every year and shopping constantly on Amazon. If you're buying the Echo to listen to music because you think that your paying the Prime Fees gives you access to it - BE WARNED. You are wasting your money! Prime does not provide music to Prime members outside the US making the Amazon ECHO a useless piece of plastic for users like us. It does not pair with iTunes... unless you route it through some other device (which is pointless if I already have another device to play my iTunes. Location infor and weather deets don't work outside the U.S. either (but let's be honest - no one pays $179.00 to be told the weather and time). In truth, it feels like a bit of a scam that this device is being sold to non-US Amazon Shoppers when it OBVIOUSLY cannot fulfil most of it's purpose outside the US. I am so angry about it that I think I will be cancelling my Prime Account too. I guess Happy Birthday to me. And my husband feels so disappointed that this thing ruined his birthday gift.",

Then I tried to set up my Echo via my Mac, by going to http://alexa.amazon.com/ in my Mac web browser (it works in Safari or Chrome) and then following the setup sequence there, which worked fine and now my Echo is up and running OK. I am still giving the Echo only one star because I had a very time-wasting and frustrating experience trying to setup the Echo via via the current (latest) version of the iPhone Alexa app, which failed repeatedly on 6/6/2016. Almost all recent feedback posts for the iPhone Alexa app complain that the app fails to setup Alexa and give the app 1 star. Without getting Alexa setup, it cannot be used at all. I hope Amazon fixes their Alexa app for the iPhone, so other customers have the same unacceptable experience.",

I do everything to trouble shoot it, unplug it, disconnect and reconnect it to the internet wifi. Nothing seems to help. Working with the Alexa app is a joke, the app hardly ever opens or loads. When it does open, it freezes up and you have to close it and restart it. The Echo doesn't connect to other devices via wifi like it should, when I try to connect it, it always says out of range, even standing right next to the thing, still out of range.

    "review_text": "My Echo arrived with an add-on I did not order. When I opened the shipping box I was startled to see several ants run out of the box (strange). As I tried to ease the Echo from the outer box, more ants swarmed up to the surface (yech). Not those cute little ones, but rather those Mutant Ninja sized ones (but not quite so big as those carpenter ants so I guess just over-achieving or, perhaps irradiated regular ants or, out of work/shape carpenter ants). I should have stopped here to entertain rational thought and should have photographed the moment for posterity.  However, being in my KITCHEN and sensing the mounting coup, at this point \"I chose violence\" and ran outside with the box at arms length - that squealing sound you may have heard was, no doubt, me. Once outside, I pull the plastic bagged Echo the remaining way out of the box. Mistake. (GROSS!) The box is loaded with ants - ants running up my hands, ants running willy-nilly to confuse me, ants carrying eggs (EGGS people!  They are clearly in this for the long-haul!), ants that apparently died in the effort of delivering my Echo (these are the only vaguely appreciated ants).  This war could have been waged  in my KITCHEN (ants are insidious planners!). The ants take their job seriously and are even guarding the interior of the Echo packaging itself.  I think I saw a sovereign flag. I know now that they have  territorialized the Echo's electronic components.  I fear the consequences of enabling Alexa with electricity.  I have seen Ant Man.  I have no desire to see a sequel in my own kitchen.  While I fought bravely, I now stare defeat in the face and accept it.  I will return to you Amazonians the Echo habitat you originally sent me. Perhaps some of the hostiles have survived to tell their tale.  Perhaps their breeding program continues deep in the heart of Alexa and you will understand that Winter is Not coming fast enough.  I await a replacement for my Echo with one without hostile add-on components.  I rate this product accordingly until I am sure the wall holds in the North and the invaders are vanquished at their source.",

My home is wired with Sonos for a wonderful sound around the house. However, Echo does not work with Sonos so if I'm playing from Spotify I have to use either my Sonos speakers or the one Echo.  Sorry Echo, but your sound quality may be good but it can't compete with Sonos.  And if you want to use Echo to play Spotify, it tells you to log into to App first to connect.

For example, Echo can't tell you who the members of a band or the cast of move/TV show are, but Google Home can.

He has taken great care of this device, but it was very slightly bumped over and fell onto his desktop which caused the top to pop off. He tried to make it work, which for awhile it did, but the top kept popping off and now it doesn't work, which is not great, especially since we paid so much for the unit. The unit was broken in May, but he tried to work around the problem. Now that popping the top on doesn't work, we can't send it back for repair, since it is now out of warranty (June 2016). We really love the idea here, but the design is flawed. Now we see cases on Amazon which help keep the Echo from falling over, which really shouldn't have been such an issue.",

I check for the newest skills (which is just a fancy name for apps) quite often to find mostly stupid individualized nonsense .  While that may prove to be a nice gimmick for some, there are still many issues that need to be addressed for the echoes usefulness.  It's being marketed as a personal assistant and in my opinion that is where it's lacking the most...!  It can take messages, notes, shopping list, etc.  But has no way of getting that information back to you.  When an alarm or timer goes off, you better remember why you set it or you will have to go looking in the app for that info when echo could have simply read it back to you with a simple app.  A simple app could enable the echo to e-mail, text or even Skype any relevant information making it way more productive as an assistant.  If Amazon engineers want the echo to be a huge success and not turn into the next fad flop, I would suggest starting with inexpensive android watch and attempt to meet or exceed its functionality which is leaps and bounds ahead of the Amazon Echo.",
